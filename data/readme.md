Original Data from SOCOM

Movement data from grey wolves (Canis lupus) in northeastern Alberta's Athabasca Oil Sands Region. Data have been used to investigate habitat use and selection (Boutin et al. 2015), predator-prey dynamics (Neilson and Boutin 2017), effects of human activity (Boutin et al. 2015; Neilson and Boutin 2017), and responses to snow conditions (Droghini and Boutin 2018). This study is participating in the Arctic Animal Movement Archive (AAMA).
